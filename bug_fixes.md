# Notification System Bug Fixes

## Initial Problem
The Flask application was experiencing an error with the notification system:
`AttributeError: 'Blueprint' object has no attribute 'before_app_first_request'`

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Blueprint decorator issue
- **Problem**: The `before_app_first_request` decorator is not valid for Blueprint objects in Flask
- **Fix**: Modified the application architecture to register the notification handlers during the application initialization phase in `app.py`

### 2. Thread context issue
- **Problem**: Notifications triggered in a separate thread were missing Flask's application context
- **Fix**: Modified the `order_status_change` event handler to properly create a thread with application context:
```python
# Create a copy of current app to use in the thread
app = current_app._get_current_object()
# Schedule notification in a separate thread to avoid blocking
def run_with_context():
    with app.app_context():
        notify_customer_status_change(target, oldvalue, value)
        
threading.Thread(
    target=run_with_context,
    name="notify_customer_status_change"
).start()
```

## Validation
Created a comprehensive testing script (`check_console.py`) to:
1. Check database state and verify orders have valid table associations
2. Create test orders when needed
3. Simulate client connections to the notification system
4. Verify notifications are correctly queued and delivered
5. Test the status change notification flow end-to-end

The testing confirmed that all fixes are working as expected and notifications are properly generated and routed to connected clients.

## Key Insights
- Flask's application context must be preserved when working with threads
- Blueprint objects have different lifecycle hooks available compared to the main application
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) with in-memory queues is an effective way to implement real-time notifications
- The notification architecture correctly handles both connected and disconnected clients by caching notifications
